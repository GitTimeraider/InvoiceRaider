Formerly a fork of https://github.com/kittendevv/Invio, however at this point enough functionality has been added and removed to make it its own project.
No changes made in the Invio project will be introduced in here anymore and it will go its own way.

### Disclaimers: 
#### AI is responsible for over half of the coding. Also keep in mind that this software is mostly developed for personal use by myself and thus might not receive all feature requests desired.

## Quick Start (Docker Compose)

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  invoiceraider:
    image: ghcr.io/gittimeraider/invoiceraider:latest
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - invoiceraider_data:/app/data
    environment:
      JWT_SECRET: change-me-to-a-long-random-string
      ADMIN_USER: admin
      ADMIN_PASS: changeme

volumes:
  invoiceraider_data:
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Then open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and log in with your configured admin credentials.

## Data Persistence

All application data is stored under `/app/data/` inside the container:

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `/app/data/app.db` | SQLite database |
| `/app/data/logos/` | Company logo uploads |
| `/app/data/templates/` | Custom invoice templates |
| `/app/data/backups/` | Automatic DB backups on schema upgrade |

Mount a named volume at `/app/data` to persist data across container restarts.

## Invoice Number Patterns

Invoice numbers can be customized in Settings using token placeholders:

| Token | Description |
|---|---|
| `{YYYY}` | Full year (e.g. 2025) |
| `{MM}` | Two-digit month |
| `{DD}` | Two-digit day |
| `{RAND4}` | 4-character random alphanumeric |

Example: `INV-{YYYY}-{MM}-{RAND4}` → `INV-2025-06-A3F9`

## Export Formats

| Format | Standard | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| PDF | — | Universal; uses WeasyPrint for rendering |
| UBL 2.1 | OASIS | General B2B electronic invoicing |
| Factur-X / ZugFeRD | EN 16931 | German/French hybrid PDF+XML |
| FatturaPA | Italian SDI | Italian electronic invoicing |

## Email Actions by Invoice Status

InvoiceRaider exposes email actions in the invoice detail view based on invoice status:

- **Draft** — Shows **Send via Email**
- **Sent** and **Overdue** — Shows **Send Reminder**
- **Paid**, **Complete**, and **Voided** — Shows **Send via Email** (same normal send flow as Draft). This is mainly intended for archiving purposes — e.g. forwarding the finalized invoice to an archive mailbox, [paperless-ngx](https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx), or another document/invoice management system — rather than for resending to the customer.

Each email configuration can define separate templates for:

- **Normal invoice emails** — Default Subject and Default Body
- **Reminder emails** — Reminder Subject and Reminder Body

When a reminder template is not set for a config, InvoiceRaider falls back to that same config's normal Subject/Body.

This behavior helps separate first-send emails from follow-up reminders while still keeping a safe fallback.

The company email shown on the invoice PDF attached to an outgoing email is automatically replaced with the actual SMTP "From" address used to send that message, so the recipient always sees an address that matches the sender and can safely reply to it.

Every send attempt (normal or reminder) is recorded in an **Email Log** on the invoice detail page, showing the mode, timestamp, and success/failure. Recipient addresses are masked by default and can be revealed with a click. SMTP servers that silently reject all recipients (e.g. when the "From" address isn't authorized for the authenticated account) are now detected and logged as a failure instead of appearing to succeed.
